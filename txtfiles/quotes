Your letter should clearly identify each item in your report you dispute, state the facts figures and explain why you dispute the information, and request that it be removed or corrected. You may want to enclose a copy of your report with the items in question circled.

Send your letter by certified mail, "return receipt requested," so you can document what the credit reporting company received. Remember to include copies of the applicable enclosures and save copies for your files.
